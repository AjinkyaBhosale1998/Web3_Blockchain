# Call and Transaction.

 

What is call ? ( Reading the data )

Call is nothing but Invoking the smart contract function without broadcasting to network
reading the state from node
read only operation and it doesn’t need any gas fee
If we want to check the balance of user for the erc20 or others tokens we use call function
Call() is used to do read data for users balance.

 

What is transaction ? (  Writing the data )

Which broadcasted to the entire network
It changes the state of blockchain and smart contract
Its write operation , requires signing from user wallet so whenever we’re doing transactions a popup Comes and we have to sign in or approve and it can’t be done without private keys.
Have to pay gas fee like in  ETH for Ethereum , sol for Solana , Matic for Polygon
If we want to transfer token or NFT from 1 user to other  we use transaction.
Send() is used to do transaction.
